A couple days ago and a few blocks from here Inter-Dimensional computer viruses or <i><b>BUG</b><i> started appearing.  You can find bugs by pointing your zapper around you.  When a light starts blinking, you've found one.  Every time you find a bug you feed more interdimensional computervirus RNA into the undergound NASA supercomputers we have trying to decrypt we need to make the anit-virus we so desprately need.<br>
So as not to raise alarm, pedicab drivers in major cities have been tasked with carrying out the eradication process.  The safty and security of this fair city, the country, the world, even our very DIMENSION are under threat and only you can help!<br>
If you're still reading after this much you should know that I'll fill more in later.  This example text needs to be long enough that I'm convinced that the StarWars lib works.  If all goes well this should be streaming nicely.
